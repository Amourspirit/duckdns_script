# Delete files from a folder for a mega.nz account.

#
# -p: Optional: -p pass in the full path directory to delete older files from Mega.nz. Default is "/Root"
# -a: Optional: -a pass in the number of days as a positive integer before todays date to delete files older then from Mega.nz. Default is 60 days.
# -i: Optional: i- pass in the configuration file to use that contain the credientials for the Mega.nz account you want to access
# -o: Optional: -o pass in the Log file to log to results of running mega_del_old.sh.
#     Can be value of "n" in which case results are outputed to the terminal window
#     Can be value of "s" in which case no results are written to a log file or terminal window.
#     Defaults to /var/log/mega_delete_old.log (requires script be run as root)
# -d: Optional: -d pass in the date of Log in the format of yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss. This will be used as the date stamp in the log file
#     Example: 2018-06-21-14-31-22
#     If -o is set to "s" this -d will be ignored.
# -v: Display the current version of this script
# -h: Display script help
#
# If this script is called from another script then having an option for log and log date makes it so the entries all have the same log date.
